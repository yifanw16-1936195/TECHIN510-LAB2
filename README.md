world Clock: https://techin510-lab2-app2.streamlit.app/

## Overview

Create a web app that reads a dataset and displays interesting data visualizations about the dataset

## Features

- Use text content widgets to write a title and introduction to your data analysis
- Use slider, dropdown, select widgets to filter data
- Use chart and maps to visualize data

## Optional Lab & Bonus

- Create a world clock app, the user should be able to select multiple cities, and the clock should update every second.
- Include a UNIX timestamp display
- Include a separate page for converting UNIX timestamp to Human time


## Reflections
1. **Import and Dependency Management**: Ensuring all necessary libraries are both installed (via **`requirements.txt`**) and correctly imported in the app script is crucial to prevent runtime errors.
2. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Understanding and interpreting error messages, such as **`NameError`**, are key skills for diagnosing and resolving issues within the app efficiently.
3. **Data Visualization Integration**: Integrating data visualization libraries like **`seaborn`** and **`matplotlib`** with Streamlit requires proper setup and imports to enhance interactivity and user engagement in data exploration apps.
